		<!-- whenever socket io library is configured on server side then by default it gets available
		 for client as well and it is available at location 
		 "http://localhost:3000/socket.io/socket.io.js"
		 so to use it on client side we are referring it as below -->
		<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			var socket = io();

			// client connected event handler
			socket.on('connect', ()=>{
				console.log('Connected to server');
			});

			// client disconencted event handler
			socket.on('disconnect', ()=>{
				console.log('Disconnected from server');
			});
